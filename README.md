# follow-along-project-

Welcome to the Follow Along Project: Milestone 1!

This project is the first step in building a full-fledged E-Commerce Application from scratch using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). It is designed to provide hands-on experience with real-world development concepts and tools, guided by a mentor.

Learning Goals ðŸŽ¯

After completing this milestone, you will:

Understand the overall structure of a MERN project.

Learn the foundational steps for setting up a new project.

Gain clarity on the functionalities of an e-commerce application.

Prepare for upcoming milestones by setting up the project repository.

Key Features of the Project

MERN Stack Implementation: A robust full-stack application using JavaScript for both frontend and backend.

REST API Creation: Learn to build scalable and efficient APIs.

Authentication: Implement secure login and registration functionalities.

Database Schema Design: Explore structured data models using MongoDB.

Backend Development: Set up a robust server-side application with Node.js and Express.

Frontend Development: Utilize React to build an interactive and user-friendly interface.

What to Expect in This Milestone

Mentor-Led Session: Learn the projectâ€™s vision, goals, and key features from your mentor.

Live Demonstration: Observe the completed applicationâ€™s functionality, user interface, and backend integration.

Core Concepts Covered

Overview of the MERN Stack

The MERN stack enables developers to use JavaScript across the entire application, making development streamlined and beginner-friendly.

REST API Structure and Endpoints

User Authentication: Register and log in users.

Product Management: Add, update, and retrieve product data.

Order Handling: Manage customer orders.

Each endpoint will:

Interact with the database.

Serve data in a structured format (typically JSON).

Basics of Database Schema Design

In MongoDB, schema design involves defining the structure and relationships of the data stored in the database.

Role of Authentication in Web Applications

Authentication verifies the identity of users before granting access to specific resources. In this e-commerce application, it ensures secure access for tasks like purchases and handling sensitive data.

Submission Guidelines

Ensure your repository is pushed to GitHub and is publicly accessible.

Include a README file with:

A brief description of the project.

A summary of Milestone 1: Project Overview.

Share the GitHub repository link in the assignment submission.

Next Steps ðŸš€

In the next lesson, we will:

Set Up the Development Environment: Install required tools and dependencies for the MERN stack.

Understand Server-Client Interaction: Learn how the frontend communicates with the backend using APIs.

Set Up a Simple Server: Create a basic server using Node.js and Express as the foundation for the project.
